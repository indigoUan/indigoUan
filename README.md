- I’m Gioele Neri, or îndigoUán when online. I live in Italy and I'm 17 years old.
- I've been coding with Haxe for roughly three or four years, and I'm currently studying HTML, JavaScript, and CSS for potential front-end centered jobs in the future.
- I attend a Health and Society highschool. I'm neither healthy nor social, but I'll take what I can.
