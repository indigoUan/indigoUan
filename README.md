- I’m îndigoUán, Gioele Neri. I live in Italy and I am 17 years old.
- I've been coding with Haxe for roughly 3/4 years, and I'm currently studying HTML, JavaScript, and CSS for potential front-end centered jobs in the future.
- I attend a Health and Society highschool. I'm neither healthy nor social, but I'll take what I can.
