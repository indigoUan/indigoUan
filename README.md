- I’m Gioele Neri, or îndigoUán when online. I live in Italy and I'm 17 years old.
- I've been coding with Haxe for roughly three or four years, and I'm currently studying HTML, JavaScript, and CSS for potential front-end centered jobs in the future.
- I attend a Health and Society highschool. I'm neither healthy nor social, but I'll take what I can.

Here are the websites/HTML5 games I made so far:
(game) [MetaTicTacToe, landscape](https://indigouan.github.io/MetaTTT/landscape)
(game) [MetaTicTacToe, portrait](https://indigouan.github.io/MetaTTT/portrait)
(site) [Super Mario 64 wall collision showcase](https://indigouan.github.io/sm64_collisions?hidecredit=false&bgcolor=484848&&initialspeed=12&stepsize=36)
